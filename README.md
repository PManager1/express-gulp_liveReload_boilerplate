#gulp boilerplate

this is a super simple gulp boilerplate that gives you the following:

* express server w/ livereload browser refresh on change
* jade compilation
* sass compilation
* coffeescript compilation

it's aim is purely to act as a simple starting point for starting with gulp.

##usage
as a prerequisite it's assumed you have `npm` installed and the `gulp-cli`.

1. clone the repo

		git clone https://github.com/jh3y/gulp-boilerplate.git

2. install dependencies

		npm install

3. start gulp with either `gulp` or `gulp --require coffee-script/register` if using a gulpfile in coffeescript.

4. start hacking away with super fast livereload goodness.
